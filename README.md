# 🔥 Wildfire Prediction

Using Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of wildfires based on environmental and meteorological factors.

### 🧩 Steps
- Module and data imports  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Feature scaling  
- Train-test splitting  
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV (optimized for RMSE)  
- Training the **KNeighborsRegressor** model using the best parameters

### 🧭 Future Work  
Further improvements could involve:
- Expanding to other machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Incorporating real-time weather and satellite data  
- Deploying the model through a web dashboard for live prediction
